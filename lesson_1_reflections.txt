Using the diff command immediately highlighted the lines which contained differences.
I didn't have to search through all the text manually.

Having access to the entire history of file changes means that I don't need to remember each change.
I don't have to keep records of each individual version, which would replicate information and require more memory.

Choosing manual (vs automatic) commits in Git means that each change has a logical meaning which makes the branch easier to understand.
It reduces the number of total commits and hence saves memory.
However it does require the user to decide when to commit and hence runs the risk of valuable information not being saved and hence lost.

Git allows saving multiple files in each commit as it deals with bigger projects that are built up of many smaller steps in files that are grouped into a repository.
Google docs deals with single documents (or files) at a time.

git log is used to show a history of all commits.
It shows the comment which describes why the commit was done.
Then use git diff to compare that commit with another.
The additions are shown in green, deletions in red.

Thanks to Git I can have complete confidence to make lots of changes to code knowing that I can always revert to a functioning version if there's a problem.

I now want to use Git for everything I do!
I could use it to track changes whilst doing my CV.
I could use it to illustrate how I build something, my thinking process.
