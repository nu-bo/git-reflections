"HEAD" is Git's name for the current commit

By initialising a repository you create a .git directory.
This .git directory contains metadata which tracks changes.

The Staging Area is an intermediate area between the Working Directory and the Repository.
Files can only be committed from the staging area.
It allows developers to organise files into a logical step before committing.
