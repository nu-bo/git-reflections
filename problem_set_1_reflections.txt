git diff will compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.
It takes two arguments - the two commit ids to compare. 

git clone will make a copy of an entire Git repository, including the history, onto your own computer.
It takes one argument - the url of the repository to copy. 

git checkout will temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit.
It takes one argument - the commit ID to restore. 

git log will show the commits made in this repository, starting with the most recent.
It doesn't take any arguments.

It's important to leave good descriptive comments for each commit as it can make it easier when debugging to identify where errors were introduced.
This saves time having to look at the code with git diff.

'Detached Head' state is when you use git checkout to look at previous commits.
If you make a change at this point and want to revert to the newer files, you will have to make a branch or stash these changes. (Haven't learned this yet.)
